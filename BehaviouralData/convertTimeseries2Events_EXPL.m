%note: this will NOT work on raw unprocessed event data directly exported
%from common annotation software- you need to run annotationImport.m first
%and then run this script

clearvars;

%edit these parameters: 
%directory where your event sequence file lives 

dataLabel = 'Behaviours';
timeCol = 2; % indicate the column that has the time stamps
dataCol = 1; % indicate the column that has infant affect codes

% set sample_rate, very important
%   sample_rate: the interval between two consecutive time stamps of converted
%           stream data.
sample_rate = .1; %.1 corr to 10fps  % 0.034 corresponds to 29.97fps (common in US)
